# hello-world
This is a practice tutorial following steps from "guides.github.com"
In an academic (astronomy and visualization research) setting for many years, I have developed and implemented many computational algorithms/codes.  I am just now joining github primarily because I am interested in developing 3D animations using COLLADA, which is quite new to me.  I will be seeking to pull working examples of COLLADA (.dae) model files from others who are already experts in this arena.
